# Auth0 Terraform Boostrap
Do you want to bootstrap a project with Auth0 and Terraform but don't know where to start? Look no further.

This is a minimal project. Clone or fork it, then populate `terraform.auto.tfvars` and you should be good to go.

```bash
$ cd tf
$ cp terraform.sample.tfvars terraform.auto.tfvars
$ vim terraform.auto.tfvars
$ make init
$ make
$ make apply
```
