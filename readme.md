# Auth0 Terraform Boostrap
Do you want to bootstrap a project with Auth0 and Terraform but don't know where to start? Look no further.

This is minimal project. No need to clone this. Just copy files/config you want into your existing project and go.

```bash
$ cp terraform.sample.tfvars terraform.auto.tfvars
$ vim terraform.auto.tfvars
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
